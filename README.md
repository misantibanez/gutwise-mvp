## 🌟 Overview
**GutWise** helps people with digestive issues (such as IBD, IBS, food sensitivities) take control of their lifestyle.  
The app combines **meal tracking, AI-powered recommendations, and proactive push notifications** to suggest safe food choices—especially when eating out.  

Our killer feature: **location-aware restaurant guidance**. GutWise detects where you are, shows safe / risky / avoid dishes based on your history, and checks in later to log symptoms—all with minimal friction.
